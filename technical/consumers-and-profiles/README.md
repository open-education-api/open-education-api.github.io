# Consumers and profiles
Since version 5.0, OOAPI has two mechanisms to support specific consumers. Sometimes specific consumers of an OOAPI endpoint should be able to request items just for them, or they need attributes that are not specified in the base specification. In other cases existing fields are being made mandatory for the project to achieve its goals.

Currently the OOAPI is used in several ways. Within institutions as an implementation to provide internal information to students, or as a canonical model to allow for the exchange of information between internal systems within an institution. OOAPI is also used as a specification to allow communication within the broader education sector. Examples of these are RIO, eduXchange and other developments are also on the way. Since the OOAPI is a broad specification, this documentation also provides information about which request and responses should be implemented to make specific consumers (applications) work.

## Filtering responses for specific consumers
The first mechanism is the `consumer` query parameter that allows clients to request items meant for a specific consumer. E.g. `GET /courses?consumer=rio`. When this query parameter is specified, the implementation should only return items needed for this consumer. The allowed values for the query parameter are defined globally in the [consumer registry](#consumer-registry). This query parameter is **only** defined for requests that return a collection of items, e.g. `GET /courses` and `GET /rooms`, **not** for requests returning a single item, e.g. `GET /course/{courseId}`.

## Extending the specification with extra attributes for specific consumers
This mechanism allows (a group of) users implementing and using OOAPI implementations to agree on a set of extra attributes that is necessary to fulfill a specific usecase. Such a mechanism also negates the necessity of providing for each and every use case in the general OOAPI specification.

Each entity described in OOAPI has a `consumers` attribute, which implementers can use to add consumer-specific attributes:

```json
{
    "...": "...",
    "consumers": [
        {
            "consumerKey": "<the consumer key>",
            "additional": "custom",
            "attributes": "here"
        }
    ]
}
```

The value of the `consumers` attribute is an array of objects. Since the value is an array, an entity can have multiple consumer objects. Each object should have at minimum the attribute `consumerKey`, which specifies the consumer for which the extra attributes are defined.

!> Currently there is no mechanism defined to request only consumer objects for a specific consumer (for example for data minimization purposes). There are however, several issues ([#296](https://github.com/open-education-api/specification/issues/296), [#292](https://github.com/open-education-api/specification/issues/292) and [#242](https://github.com/open-education-api/specification/issues/242)) that discuss adding such mechanisms.

!> Note that the consumer query parameter and the consumer objects are related but separate things! It is perfectly valid to use one without the other.

## Consumer registry
The following table lists which consumer keys are in use by which consumers. This list only shows the official and registered consumers of the OOAPI that are part of the specification and are maintained by OOAPI. Implementations that want to use this mechanism without registering a key, should prefix their key with `x-`. The registered consumers are: 

| Key        | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rio        | RIO is a central registry, maintained by the Dutch Government that lists all educational institutions and the education they offer. |
| eduxchange | eduXchange is a website that allows students to easily enroll in education from other institutions.                                 |

Consumers that are registered are maintained by the OOAPI. These consumers serve a specific usecase and are implemented by multiple solutions and organisations. In order to register a new consumer and include it in the specification a request can be made for a 'consumer adoption' via Github. This is applicable if a new consumer needs to be maintained via the OOAPI governance. As a requestor you can be involved in the future maintenance of the consumer.

## Consumer versioning
Consumers that are part of the standard are being kept in sync with the versioning schema of the OOAPI. This is required to communicate with which OOAPI versions a consumer is compatible and can be used. The basic rule is that the major version number of the OOAPI standard always needs to be adopted by the consumer specification: 
0.	A new major version of the OOAPI is released, all consumers need to be reviewed and if required adjusted:
This always results in a new consumer version (with or without changes) following the major version number of the OOAPI standard.

Besides this basic rule. Three situations (1a, 1bcan occur:
1.	A new OOAPI minor version is released, consumers can be:
a.	Compatible with the new release, and require no change:
The consumer version will not change to indicate the backwards (and forward) compatibility 
b.	Not compatible with the new OOAPI release, any impact on the consumer needs to be reviewed and resolved. A new consumer release will take place:
The consumer version number of this new release will change and will use the lowest (or current) minor version of the OOAPI specification to which it is backwards compatible. This could be the current minor version, but also one or multiple earlier minor releases. If this conflicts with an earlier consumer version number, an patch number is introduced/increased. 
2.	A new consumer version is released without a new OOAPI release:
The consumer version number will use the patch version number, introducing/increasing the patch version number following the lowest minor release of the OOAPI to which this release is compatible with.

An example of the versioning of consumers based on these rules is shown in the following table:

## Profiles
In addition to the `consumer` query parameter and the `consumer` object, it might be necessary for a specific application or usecase to specify which requests should be implemented for it to work. One can also imagine that applications at times need attributes that are not required in the base specification. To specify such requirements we recognize "profiles". Since there is no specific format to specify such a profile yet, for now profiles are simply described using text and lists.
