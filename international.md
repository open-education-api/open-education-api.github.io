# International usage and considerations
### Dutch Roots

The open education standard has its roots in the Netherlands and was created to accommodate an educational application landscape that is more flexible. Since the OOAPI is an open standard, it can be used internationally.

- The standard is based on the English language
- English is the official language used in the Github repository

### International view
The technical working group and Surf follow the developments on European and International standards. European and International tuning is important and new developments help the educational landscape moving forward.
At the moment European developments like Erasmus Without Papers+ and ECTS Course Catalog are important drivers for the development of the OOAPI.
We notice the OOAPI standard is used more and more internationally. Several European University alliances are using OOAPI:

- Enlight uses OOAPI internally
- Unita has mapped the course catalogue on OOAPI
- Aurora is investigating the possibilities of OOAPI
