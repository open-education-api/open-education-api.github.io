# Community

The Community consists of members (representatives) of education institutions and suppliers that work closely with SURF to further define and develop the Open Education API. Community members participate actively in the project and are encouraged to:

* share education data so that it can be implemented in the Open Education API.
* propose potential modifications to the specification.
* ask questions and provide feedback.
* contribute towards an active Community site.

This enables for efficient sharing of education data, which benefits the members of the Community as well as their end-users. Community members can also be part of the [Working Group](community/workinggroup.md).
