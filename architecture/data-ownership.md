# OOAPI (data) ownership

The OOAPI Specification is a set of definitions that help institutions to make their internal data accessible. The specification itself is owned by the workgroup. Changes to the specification can be made according to the [governance bylaws](governance/). 

Institutions who want to provide access to their internal data by using the OOAPI specification do so at their own responsibility. The OOAPI workgroup has provided an overview of the classification of the different endpoints. The data institutions provide is owned by the institutions or ownership is provided by proxy from students. In the later case students agree to have their data processed by the institution. 

When data is aggregated for example for the purpose of a course catalog or a combined cross institutional rostering app, ownership of the data is still in the hands of the student or institution.
