# OOAPI cross-sectoral cooperation

The OOAPI has been developed primarily for use in Vocational Education, University of Professional Education and University of Sience (MBO, HBO and WO).

Work has been done to map teh OOAPI v5 to the RIO datamodel. This mapping has resulted in additional objects and consumer elements. More infromation on this can be found [here](technical/consumers-and-profiles/rio).
