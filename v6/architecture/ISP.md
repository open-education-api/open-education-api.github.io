# Mapping OOAPI to BIV 

## CIA and BIV
CIA (or in Dutch BIV) classifications help institutions choose proper measures to secure and optimise systems that have been classified. CIA is an acronym for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. More information on CIA/BIV can be found [here](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIV-classificatie)

## Institutions in the lead 
Determining the CIA classification of an OOAPI endpoint is usually done by institutions themselves since they are in the best position to assess impact regarding for instance availability issues. 

## Classification through matching
This document helps institutions to get a general overview of the objects within the specification and their preliminary CIA classification. The objects and specifically the endpoints in question are [OOAPI endpoints](https://open-education-api.github.io/specification/v5/docs.html). To make a preliminary CIA classification we have chosen to map the endpoints to [HORA](https://www.wikixl.nl/wiki/hora/index.php/Hoofdpagina). This is done by mapping the OOAPI objects to HORA business objects. These HORA business objects already have a CIA consensus from architects at the educational institutions.

## CIA and BIV
CIA (or BIV) is a triad of 
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

These three elements of the triad are then classified in 4 different levels:
- H = high
- M = medium,
- L = low,
- P = publicly available
