The working group is open to other members of other educational sectors.

Owing to the scope of SURF, these sectors are currently limited to intermediate vocational education and Higher education (MBO/HBO, WO en UMC's). For other sectors to join, the governance arrangements of the working group would need to be revised.
Currently there is interest from intermediate vocational educational institutions to use the specification, see [programme OKE](https://github.com/NetwerkExamineringDigitalisering/NED-OOAPI).
