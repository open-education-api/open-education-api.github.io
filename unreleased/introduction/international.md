## Dutch roots

The Open Education API (OEAPI) has its roots in the Netherlands and was
created to support a more flexible educational application landscape.
As an open standard, the OEAPI can be used internationally.

The standard is based on the English language, specifically British
English. English is the official working language used in the GitHub
repositories.

## International perspective

The Technical Working Group and SURF actively follow developments in
European and international standards. Alignment at European and
international level is important, as new developments help to move the
educational landscape forward.

At present, European initiatives such as Erasmus Without Papers+ and
the ECTS Course Catalogue are important drivers for the development of
the OEAPI.

We see the OEAPI being used increasingly at international level.
Several European university alliances already make use of the OEAPI:

- Enlight uses the OEAPI internally
- UNITA has mapped its course catalogue to the OEAPI
- Aurora is investigating the possibilities of using the OEAPI

## Join us

One of the key pillars of the OEAPI standard is the active involvement
of its users. Their feedback and contributions help to guide the
ongoing development of the standard where needed. For this reason, a
new governance model is currently being developed.

Participation in the Technical Working Group is open to partners
outside the Netherlands.

- OEAPI meetings take place during European working hours
- OEAPI meetings are public
- OEAPI meeting notes are written in English
- OEAPI descriptions are written in English
