# OEAPI scope

The OEAPI specification is aimed at providing information related to
student activities and the general information needs of students.

Examples of the use of the OEAPI are:

* Detailed information on courses available at an institution on a
  shared website
* Timetable information for a student in a student app
* Course results in a student app

The current implementation of OEAPI is aimed at data in transit. It
provides information that is currently available and can be aggregated
from within an educational institution. In the current iteration of the
OEAPI, we are not focusing on historical data or the versioning of a
given data element.

Specifically for the RIO implementation, historical data is now also
being made available.

The current scope of the OEAPI, as mapped to the
[HORA](https://www.surf.nl/hoger-onderwijs-referentie-architectuur-hora)
information objects, is shown in the figure below:
