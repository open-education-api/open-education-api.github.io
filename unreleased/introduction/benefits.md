# Benefits of using the Open Education API (OEAPI)

Using the Open Education API (OEAPI) delivers clear efficiency gains for
organisations, as well as tangible improvements to the student journey.
By working with a shared open standard, institutions can innovate more
quickly while offering students a more coherent digital experience.

## Benefits for development teams

- Faster development cycles thanks to standardisation
- No major upfront investment required to get started
- Easier data exchange with other educational institutions
- No need to build and maintain bespoke APIs for each partner or system
- Reuse of third-party applications across multiple institutions
- Secure information sharing within a trusted ecosystem
- Continuous knowledge sharing through collaboration with other
  institutions using the OEAPI

## Benefits for students and their educational journey

By incorporating the OEAPI into the IT landscape, students can easily:

- Use a smartphone to find the nearest available computer
- Check the status of their study credits via an app
- Register online for courses or tests
- View class timetables on a smartphone
- Securely access examination results
- And much more

To protect personal data, such as examination results and timetables, it
is recommended to use an authorisation server that supports OAuth 2.0, in
combination with SURFconext. These security measures are not part of the
OEAPI itself, but their use is strongly advised.
