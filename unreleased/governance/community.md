# Community

The Community consists of members (representatives) of educational
institutions and suppliers who work closely with SURF to further define and
develop the Open Education API. Community members participate actively in
the project and are encouraged to:

* share education data so that it can be implemented in the Open Education API.
* propose potential modifications to the specification.
* ask questions and provide feedback.
* contribute to an active Community site.

This enables efficient sharing of education data, benefiting both Community
members and their end users. Community members may also take part in the
[Technical Working Group](community/workinggroup.md).

If you wish to join the Community and stay informed of the latest
developments, please use the following link:
