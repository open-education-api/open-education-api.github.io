Educational institutions are increasingly sharing education data:
with their students via apps, between different systems within an
institution and with other institutions.

The underlying data, however, are stored in various systems, such as
databases, both within and outside educational institutions. To be able
to communicate with these systems, a set of definitions known as an
Application Programming Interface (API) is required.

## A standard is needed

Of course, each school, college or university can develop its own APIs,
but this is a time-consuming and costly process. That is why the Open
Education API was
created. The OEAPI conforms to the design principles of REST
Representational State Transfer, a flexible, lightweight way of
integrating applications.

This open API is the result of a collaboration between several
educational institutions and suppliers in the Netherlands and is
facilitated by SURF, known collectively as the Community. Within the
Technical Working Group of the Community, the OEAPI is constantly defined and
developed so that new and existing education data can be processed
efficiently.

## OEAPI is widely supported

Via the Dutch Npuls programme, MBO, HBO and WO institutions have
embraced the OEAPI standard. Implementation of the standard is needed
to be future-ready. Dutch, but also international institutions, are
working with the OEAPI standard. Check out the Npuls programme
https://npuls.nl/en/ and specifically more information about Technology
Infrastructure at
https://npuls.nl/en/technology-infrastructure/.

Not only Dutch educational institutions, but also international
institutions find their way to OEAPI. Increasingly, there are
international initiatives and use cases. Check out the page about
international usage and find out more on our use cases page.

## Creating a standard together

Apps are constantly evolving. To create an all-encompassing standard
API, it is essential to understand the ever-changing needs of the
various educational institutions. Therefore, the Community places great
value on working closely together to create a standard API the OEAPI
that best serves as many educational institutions in the Netherlands as
possible.

Furthermore, educational institutions that want to publish education
data in a standardised way can implement their own API based on the
OEAPI standard.
