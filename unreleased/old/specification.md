# The specification
The actual OEAPI specification is specified using the [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/), a standard that specifies how to specify (among other things) REST APIs. The detailed OEAPI specifications can be found here:

* [OEAPI v6](https://open-education-api.github.io/specification/v6.0/docs.html) (Current version)

These are the previous versions:
* [OEAPI v5](https://open-education-api.github.io/specification/v5/docs.html) (extended support)

* [OEAPI v4](https://open-education-api.github.io/specification/v4/docs.html) (extended support)
