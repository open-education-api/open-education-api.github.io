# OOAPI implementations

Currently the OOAPI is implemented at: universities of applied sciences, universities and cross-sectoral. An example of the latter is a tool implemented for the acceleration [zone flexible education](https://versnellingsplan.nl/english/zones/flexibilisation/). Another example of such cross-sectoral implementations is the current development of the RIO adapter and the SURFeduhub.
