# OEAPI cross-sectoral cooperation

The OEAPI has been developed primarily for use in vocational education,
universities of applied sciences and research universities (in Dutch:
MBO, HBO and WO).

Work has been undertaken to map OEAPI v5 to the RIO data model. This
mapping has resulted in additional objects and consumer elements.
Further information can be found [here](technical/consumers-and-profiles/rio).
