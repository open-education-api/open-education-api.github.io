# OEAPI (data) ownership

The OEAPI Specification is a set of definitions that enable institutions
to make their internal data accessible. The specification itself is
owned by the workgroup. Changes to the specification can be made
according to the [governance by-laws](governance/).

Institutions that wish to provide access to their internal data through
the OEAPI specification do so under their own responsibility. The OEAPI
workgroup has provided an overview of the classification of the
different endpoints. The data institutions provide is owned by the
institutions or ownership is delegated on behalf of students. In the
latter case, students agree to have their data processed by the
institution.

When data is aggregated, for example for the purpose of a course
catalogue or a combined cross-institutional timetabling app, ownership
of the data remains with the student or institution.
