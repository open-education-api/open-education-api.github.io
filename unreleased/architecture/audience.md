Owing to the scope of SURF, these sectors are currently limited to
intermediate vocational education and higher education
(MBO/HBO, WO and UMCs). For other sectors to join, the governance
arrangements of the Technical Working Group would need to be revised.

There is currently interest from intermediate vocational education
institutions in using the specification. See the
[programme OKE]
