# OEAPI Purpose

The aim of the OEAPI specification is to standardise the exchange of
information between institutions using the API. This enables developers
of future applications to work with well-defined endpoints, thereby
making system integration easier.

The current use case for OEAPI v5.0 is depicted in the figure below:

In the future, additional integration projects may be developed based
on the OEAPI information model.
