# Supply chain

Currently, institutions for Higher Education face significant overhead
in developing and supporting different types of data exchanges. In the
current AS-IS situation, most of the effort required to provide data to
potential users of the data, such as DUO, KOM, eduXchange, etc., lies
with the institutions. They need to provide a broad set of interfaces.

Further development of the OEAPI and the provision of additional
support for other interface types on top of the current data model
would alleviate the amount of effort needed by the institutions. A
possible future would then look like the image below.
