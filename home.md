# Open Education API

## Open Education API for interoperability
Educational institutes are increasingly sharing education data: with their students via apps, between different systems within an institution and with other institutions.
The underlying data, however, are stored in various systems (i.e. databases) both within and outside the educational institutes. And to be able to communicate with these systems a set of definitions known as an API (Application Programming Interface) is required.

## A standard is needed
Of course each school, college, or university can develop their own APIs, but this is a time-consuming and costly process. That is why the Open Education API, known in Dutch as the ‘Open Onderwijs API’ (OOAPI), was created. The OOAPI conforms to the design principles of REST (Representational State Transfer) - a flexible, lightweight way of integrating applications.

This open API, is the result of a collaboration between several education institutes and suppliers in the Netherlands and is facilitated by SURF (known collectively as the Community). Within the Working Group of the Community, the OOAPI is being constantly defined and developed so that new and existing education data can be efficiently processed.

## OOAPI is widely supported
Via the Dutch Npuls programme MBO, HBO and WO institutions have embraced the OOAPI standard. Implementation of the standard is needed to be future ready. Dutch, but also international insitutions, are working with the OOAPI standard. Check out the [Npuls programme](https://npuls.nl/en/) and specifically more information about [Technology Infrastructure](https://npuls.nl/en/technology-infrastructure/).
Not only Dutch educational insittutions, but also international institutions find their way to OOAPI. More and more there are international initiatives and usecases. Check out this page about international usage and find out more on our [usecases page](usecases/).

## Creating a standard together
Apps are constantly evolving…To create an all-encompassing, standard API, it is essential to understand the ever-changing needs of the various educational institutes. Therefore, the Community places great value on working closely together to create a standard API (the OOAPI) that best serves as many educational institutes in the Netherlands as possible.

Furthermore, educational institutes that want to publish education data in a standardized way can implement their own API, based on the OOAPI standard.

## Interested in joining us?
Are you an educational institute and interested in having the OOAPI developed to suit your needs? Then why not join us. You can find more information [here: Community](community/).
