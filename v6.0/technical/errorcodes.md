# Error codes

This page describes all error responses that MAY be returned by OEAPI
endpoints.

All OEAPI-defined error responses are returned using the
`application/problem+json` media type, conforming to
[RFC 7807 – Problem Details for HTTP APIs].

Each error code is described with:

- its intended usage within OEAPI
- behavioural rules
- concrete JSON examples

---

## Error response format

All OEAPI error responses MUST conform to the Problem Details format.

### Common fields

All OEAPI error responses MUST include the following required Problem Details
fields:

- `type`
- `status`
- `title`

Other Problem Details fields are optional unless explicitly stated otherwise.

| Field      | Required | Description                             |
|------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `type`     | MUST     | A URI identifying the problem type      |
| `title`    | MUST     | A short, human-readable summary         |
| `status`   | MUST     | The HTTP status code                    |
| `detail`   | MAY      | A human-readable explanation            |
| `instance` | MAY      | A URI identifying the specific request instance |

Some error responses MAY define additional fields.

---

## 400 Bad Request

Returned when the request cannot be processed due to invalid client input.

Typical causes:

- Invalid query parameter values
- Invalid request body structure
- Unsupported enum values
- Missing required fields

This error indicates a client-side issue that can be corrected.

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.org/problems/invalid-parameter",
  "title": "Invalid request parameters",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "The query parameter 'mode' must be one of: full, basic.",
  "instance": "https://api.example.org/courses?mode=invalid"
}
```

---

## 401 Unauthorized

Returned when authentication credentials are missing, invalid, or expired.

This error MUST be returned when authentication fails.

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.org/problems/unauthorized",
  "title": "Unauthorized",
  "status": 401,
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were missing or invalid.",
  "instance": "https://api.example.org/student/12345"
}
```

---

## 403 Forbidden

Returned when authentication succeeded but the authenticated client is not
authorised to access the requested resource.

This indicates a permission issue, not an authentication issue.

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.org/problems/forbidden",
  "title": "Forbidden",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "You do not have permission to access this resource.",
  "instance": "https://api.example.org/admin/enrolments"
}
```

---

## 404 Not Found

Returned only when a specific resource instance cannot be located.

Rules:

- Instance endpoints MAY return `404`
- Collection endpoints MUST NOT return `404` for empty results
- Empty collections MUST return `200` with an empty array

### Example – instance not found

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.org/problems/not-found",
  "title": "Resource not found",
  "status": 404,
  "detail": "The course with id 'abc123' could not be found.",
  "instance": "https://api.example.org/courses/abc123"
}
```

---

## 405 Method Not Allowed

Returned when the HTTP method is not supported for the requested endpoint.

Servers SHOULD return an `Allow` header indicating supported methods.

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.org/problems/method-not-allowed",
  "title": "Method not allowed",
  "status": 405,
  "detail": "The method POST is not supported for this endpoint.",
  "instance": "https://api.example.org/courses/abc123"
}
```

---

## 406 Not Acceptable (Version negotiation)

Returned when the server cannot provide a representation for the requested
OEAPI version or consumer version.

OEAPI uses header-based version negotiation with an explicit request for a
single OEAPI version and, where applicable, a single consumer and consumer
version.

Clients MUST request exactly one OEAPI version via the `Accept` header and MAY
also include exactly one consumer and one consumer version. For example:

```http
Accept: application/vnd.oeapi+json;version=6.0;consumer=mbo-oke-roster-service;consumer-version=2.0
```

The server evaluates whether the requested OEAPI version or a compatible minor
version within the same major version can be provided.

If a compatible version can be provided, the server returns the response using
the `Content-Type` header to indicate the actual OEAPI version and consumer
version used. For example:

```http
Content-Type: application/vnd.oeapi+json;version=6.1;consumer=mbo-oke-roster-service;consumer-version=6.1
```

If no compatible version is available, a `406 Not Acceptable` response MUST be
returned.

This behaviour differs from traditional HTTP content negotiation semantics:

- exactly one explicit version is requested
- any compatible minor version may be returned
- the same principle may apply to the optional consumer type and version

This behaviour intentionally differs from traditional HTTP content negotiation
to:

- make version mismatches explicit
- improve interoperability
- improve logging and diagnostics

### Example – unsupported OEAPI version

Client:

```http
POST /enrolments
Accept: application/vnd.oeapi+json;version=7.0;consumer=mbo-oke-roster-service;consumer-version=7.0
```

Server:

```http
HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
```

Response body:

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.org/problems/version-not-acceptable",
  "title": "Version not acceptable",
  "status": 406,
  "detail": "The requested OEAPI version '7.0' cannot be served.",
  "requestedVersion": "7.0",
  "supportedVersions": ["5.0", "6.1"],
  "instance": "https://api.example.org/courses"
}
```

### Example – unsupported consumer version

Client:

```http
POST /enrolments
Content-Type: application/vnd.oeapi+json;version=6.1;consumer=mbo-oke-roster-service;consumer-version=6.1.1
```

Server:

```http
HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
```

Response body:

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.org/problems/version-not-acceptable",
  "title": "Version not acceptable",
  "status": 406,
  "detail": "The requested consumer version '6.1.1' cannot be served.",
  "consumer": {
    "consumerKey": "mbo-oke-roster-service"
  },
  "requestedVersion": "6.1.1",
  "supportedVersions": ["0.95", "1.0", "2.1"],
  "instance": "https://api.example.org/courses"
}
```

---

## 429 Too Many Requests

Returned when the client exceeds server-defined rate limits.

Clients SHOULD implement retry logic using back-off strategies.

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.org/problems/too-many-requests",
  "title": "Too many requests",
  "status": 429,
  "detail": "You have exceeded the rate limit of 100 requests per minute.",
  "instance": "https://api.example.org/courses"
}
```

---

## 500 Internal Server Error

Returned when an unexpected error occurs while processing a valid request.

This indicates a server-side failure.

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.org/problems/internal-server-error",
  "title": "Internal server error",
  "status": 500,
  "detail": "An unexpected error occurred while processing your request.",
  "instance": "https://api.example.org/enrolments/submit"
}
```
