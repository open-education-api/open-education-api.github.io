# OOAPI cross-sectoral cooperation

The OOAPI has been developed primarily for use in vocational education, universities of applied sciences and universities of science (in Dutch: MBO, HBO and WO).

Work has been carried out to map the OOAPI v5 to the RIO data model. This mapping has resulted in additional objects and consumer elements. Further information can be found [here](technical/consumers-and-profiles/rio).
