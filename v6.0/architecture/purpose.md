# OOAPI Purpose

The aim of the OOAPI specification is to standardise the exchange of information by institutions using the API. This will allow builders of future applications to work with a well-defined endpoint thus making system integration easier.

The current use case for the OOAPI v5.0 is depicted in the figure below:

In the future, more integration projects might be created based on the OOAPI information model.
