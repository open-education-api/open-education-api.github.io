# Governance
*Governance document 1 January 2019, Version: 3*

The governance model describes the decision-making process and the role of various members of the [Community](#community-governance), [Working group](#working-group-governance), and [Edustandaard](#edustandaard-governance). It also outlines the strategic goals and procedures within the project, and provides an understanding of how the Open Education API is governed. In addition to these bodies, the Steering Committee serves as the final decision-making authority. It ensures alignment with sector-wide objectives, approves major changes to the specification, and validates recommendations from the Working Group and Edustandaard before they are formally adopted.

The shared goals of the governance model are:

* **Sustainability**: ensure the sustainability and health of the project and the Community.
* **Structure**: provide structure to the organisation so that the decision-making process is clear.
* **Transparency**: provide transparency to the Community about the participation in and decision-making within the project;
* **Growth**: provide a structure that can develop according to the needs of new adopters and developers, and that can support the Community.
* **Development**: support effective development and maintenance of the Open Education API.

## Community (governance)
The Community consists of members (representatives) of educational institutions and suppliers that work closely with SURF to further define and develop the Open Education API. See [Community](community/) for more information. 

## Working group (governance)
The Working group is a subgroup of the Community and consists of a number of members that meet on a regular basis. See [Working group](community/workinggroup.md)

### Who can join the working group?
* Participation is not limited to higher educational institutions, and is open to anyone who can represent the interests of the OOAPI. Suppliers can therefore also join the working group.
* The ratio between institutions affiliated with SURF and organisations not affiliated with SURF must be at least 3:1.

### List of affiliated institutions
* A member of the working group may represent up to one higher educational institution or organisation.
* The working group may have more than one member from the same institution, but if there are more than 20 members in the working group, the maximum number of members per institution is limited to one. If a member of the working group is unable to attend a meeting, an alternate member may be appointed.

### Becoming a member of the working group
* Prospective members can enlist by posting a motivation message on the community site or sending an email to info@openonderwijsapi.nl, with a brief motivation.
* A prospective member may also be nominated by a member of the working group.
* The working group votes on membership of an organisation not affiliated with SURF.
* Any new member of the working group must have an authorised signatory of the institution or organisation they work for is required to sign a letter of intent in which they agree to the rights and obligations of the working group member.

### Terminating membership of the working group
* A working group member can terminate their membership through the mailing list.
* The working group may terminate the membership of a member who fails to meet their obligations.
* Former working group members can be kept informed of developments, if desired, but lose their voting rights.

### Rights and obligations
The working group member:

* represents their employer, an organisation that promotes the interests of the Open Education API. This organisation has the intention to implement the OOAPI within 2 years.
* actively contributes to developing the Open Education API and promotes its use. He or she must invest at least 60 hours a year to achieve the working group's objectives.
* must visit at least 3 working group meetings a year. Only institutions affiliated with SURF and 1 representative for each institution affiliated with SURF have voting rights.

## Edustandaard (governance)
[Edustandaard](https://www.edustandaard.nl/) is a platform where public and private parties in the research and educational fields in the Netherlands collaborate to make agreements on important matters. These agreements, for example, include how to use recognised concepts to find digital learning material, or transfer education data from one system to another.

The Edustandaard platform ensures knowledge sharing, communication and interaction between services, systems, and organisations, which in turn improves the digital online experience of pupils, students and researchers alike.

Amongst others, Edustandaard:

* gives advice on specific standards for the research and educational sectors.
* manages agreements, architectures, and standards.
* manages the chain reference architecture [ROSA](https://rosa.wikixl.nl/) for the entire education domain.
* safeguards the agreed standards.

Collaboration within Edustandaard takes place within:

* the **Standardisation council** (a council consisting of directors of educational institutions, public and private organisations),
* the **Architecture council**, and
* the **Edustandaard working groups**.

To achieve their goals the bureau also maintains contact with other (national and international) standards organisations.

### Edustandaard and the OOAPI
For the Open Education API, Edustandaard:

* gives advice on and manage the standardisation of the OOAPI.
* ensure that the OOAPI conforms to other standards in the context of ROSA by means of a ROSA scan.
* inform the Community about updates and changes to the OOAPI.
* publish all relevant information concerning the OOAPI on the [Edustandaard website](https://www.edustandaard.nl/), including the OOAPI specification, updates and changes to the OOAPI, and formal documentation.

## Decisions within GitHub
For issues that affect the GitHub environment ([https://github.com/open-education-api](https://github.com/open-education-api "https://github.com/open-education-api")), the following applies:

* The issue should be submitted to the master committer.
* The master committer then has 5 days to reach a decision.
* The decision is recorded within the GitHub environment.
* The voting procedure is started within these 5 days so that the decision can be voted on.
* The outcome of the vote is recorded.
* Any follow-up action is taken depending on the outcome of the vote.

## By-laws and code of conduct
