| OOAPI                            | The Open Education API. In Dutch we say: Open Onderwijs API, hence the abbreviation OOAPI. This is a standardized API specification, developed by SURF in close collaboration with higher educational institutions and suppliers. Using this API, higher education institutions can make useful information available, such as grades, study credits, schedules and free workstations. Application developers can then integrate this data into new applications.                                                                                                                       |
| Working group                    | The OOAPI working group is responsible for annual planning, development, management, promotion, community, communication, adoption and evaluation of the Open Education API specification. This working group consists of members of various institutions, suppliers and SURF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Bureau Edustandaard              | Bureau Edustandaard, a partnership between SURF and Kennisnet, is responsible for managing and advising on education-specific and research-specific standards.

The bureau also maintains contact with other (national and international) standards organisations. The Standardisation council consists of directors of educational institutions, public and private organisations. |
